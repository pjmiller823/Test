    <p id="p1"> At 28 I am just young enough to have always been around computers and the internet yet for it to not have always been a huge part of my life. Primarily this has been because when Javascript came out I was 7 years old and my school had just installed a new computer lab. However because of the design issues, the clunkiness and lack of accessible content, I avoided investing any time. So the growth of web page design has directly effected my life. What’s funny is over the last couple of years I’ve noticed the paradigm shift that has occurred in layout, pinned bars, etc and not given any thought to how it’s changed how I use the computer.</p>
    <h3>Where it's going</h3>
    <p id="p2"> Obviously the web isn’t going away, and today’s kids will constantly be connected in some way or another. Because of that, I believe that there will be two major pushes in web design and accessibility: attempting to integrate the web into every aspect of our lives, waking and otherwise, and the push back to limit the reach of the web to just on devices. I believe the first option will win initially and we’ll start to see things like driverless cars operating on a city wide network and eventually bio inserts. However after the initial success I can see a large number of people attempting to create some sort of digital faraday cage to ensure privacy.</p>
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p id="p3"> While I’m excited to watch these developments happen, I have no idea who will win. </p>
